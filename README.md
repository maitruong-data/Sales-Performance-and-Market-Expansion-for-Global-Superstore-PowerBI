## 📌Overview
🎯**Project Objectives**
This project uses Power BI to analyze and visualize global sale data for a retail company named Superstore, which operates across multiple markets and continents. The company is growing fast and aiming to expand their markets and strategic products
Our main goals are:
- 

❓**Business questions**
- Overall performance: How is the business performing in terms of sales, profit, and order return rate in different years, market and product categories?
- Market performance: How different markets are performing and where should we expand?
- Product performance: What are strategic products should be prioritized?

👤**Target Audience**
- Senior Managers, Regional Managers or Finance Managers who need a reliable view of business performance to compare markets and products, where are they winning or losing, to guide market expansion and product strategy
- Product Managers, Business Strategy, Marketing and Management teams who decide market growth, strategic products and marketing strategies
- Data analysts and Data team who are looking for actionable insights


Using SQL/BigQuery and a dashboard, the project turns raw transactional data into:

Clear views of where growth is happening and where it is slowing down

Signals on which markets to prioritize for expansion

Insights on which products should be strategic bets and which may need to be fixed, repositioned, or removed

These insights support decisions such as:

Setting revenue growth targets by region

Choosing strategic product lines to push in each market

Reducing returns and margin leakage by spotting problems early



The dataset includes:
- Order: sales transaction
- People: sales managers responsible for each region
- Returns: orders that were returned by customers
