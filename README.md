### Objective
#### 📖 What is this project about?
This project uses Power BI to analyze and visualize global sale data for a retail company named Superstore, which operates across multiple markets and continents. The company is growing fast and aiming to expand their markets and strategic products\
The dataset includes:\
- Order: sales transaction
- People: sales managers responsible for each region
- Returns: orders that were returned by customers

❓**Business questions**:
- Overall performance: How is the business performing in terms of sales, profit, and order return rate in different years, market and product categories?
- Market performance: How different markets are performing and where should Superstore expand?
- Product performance: What are strategic products should be prioritized?

Using SQL/BigQuery and a dashboard, the project turns raw transactional data into:

Clear views of where growth is happening and where it is slowing down

Signals on which markets to prioritize for expansion

Insights on which products should be strategic bets and which may need to be fixed, repositioned, or removed

These insights support decisions such as:

Setting revenue growth targets by region

Reducing returns and margin leakage by spotting problems early
